STEPS FOR RGB EXTRACTION

implement missing parts in EpicKitchensDataset (utils.loaders)
need to find the I3D checkpoints (maybe "pretrained_i3d"??) and download them and set the resume_from yaml property
need to download the epicKitchens subset made available by polito and then set the dataset.RGB.data_path property
run save_feat.py and hope for the best, heheheh
yaml: 
    name = feat_extraction ?
    resume_from = path to saved I3D checkpoint
    action = save
    models.RGB.model = I3D
    dataset.RGB.data_path = path to the Epic Kitchens videos
    dataset.shift = TBD
